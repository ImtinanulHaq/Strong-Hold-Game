# Strong-Hold-Game
This OOP project was developed to implement core concepts like encapsulation, inheritance, and abstraction through a practical game. Each team member contributed to various systems such as population, economy, military, and events. The experience enhanced our skills in object-oriented design, collaboration, and real-world problem-solving.
